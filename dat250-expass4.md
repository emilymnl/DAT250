# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 4

### Technical problems that you encountered during installation and use of Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) and how you resolved
The same technical problem that occured when doing expass 2. Please see https://github.com/emilymnl/DAT250/blob/master/dat250-expass2.md. I even tried to remove every tool and software, and then download/install everything back down in expass 2 now and start expass 2 from scratch. Yet nothing seem to work now either and I spent several hours going through the same process without coming any further.

### Any pending issues with this assignment which you did not manage to solve
Issues with JPA, plus the fact that I can not find the required javax.persistence_\*.jar-file from the EclipseLink Installer Zip.
